## Personal Background

My name is Ben Bragg. My email is bugsydor@byui.edu, and my I-number is 46-821-4951. I have completed Math 425, and am currently taking CS 450 and Math 488. I am most interested in data engineering and in applying my knowledge to practical problems, and plan to find work doing this as soon as I can after graduation.

## Project Proposal Background

The IEEE and NASPI are hosting a contest to solve a problem: Their current models are failing to predict the sources of electrical oscillations in the power grid. If I can use my skill with data analytics to consistently predict where oscillations will appear based on input from Phase Measuring Units (PMUs), that would greatly aid power grid stability as we transition more to renewable energy sources.

## Domain to Investigate

In the domain itself, I will need to learn about PMUs and their use in detecting power oscillations, about power oscillations in general, and how to employ machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes.

## Proposed Deliverables

In addition to the standard project deliverables, I will need: 

* Multiple regression models to narrow down potential oscillation sources

* To learn how to create and use machine learning models

* Machine learning models to zero in on actual oscillation sources

* To correct for unreliable input data

* Respond to the contest by June 11

## Faculty Request

I am already working with Brother Brett Amidan on this project.
