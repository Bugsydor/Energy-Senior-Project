# Imagine a time series of length n and width k. The length is the number of timesteps, 
# and the width is the number of variables in a multivariate time series.

# The convolution kernels always have the same width as the time series, while their length can be varied.


# More specifically, the pooling kernel size is determined by the formula n/p, 
# where n is the length of the time series, and p is a pooling factor, 
# typically chosen between the values {2, 3, 5}. 
# This stage is called local convolution because each branch is processed independently.

#### Machine Learning Mastery Notes ####

# https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-convolutional-neural-network-models-for-time-series-forecasting/

# Really, the data I'm looking at are univariate. That is, I only want the model to predict based on
# one column at a time.

# It's looking like my best option for preparing my data is to flag each row (or chunk of rows).

# Also, split the tibble into lists where each column is a list.

# Pseudocode:

# split univariate sequence into samples
splitter <- function(column, n_steps){
  X <- list()
  y <- list()
  
  for (i in 1:length(column)) {
    # find the end of this pattern
    end_ix <- i + n_steps
    # check if we are beyond the sequence
    if (end_ix > length(column)) {
      break
    }
    # gather input and output parts of the pattern
    seq_x <- column[i:end_ix]
    print(seq_x)
    seq_y <- column[end_ix]
    append(X, seq_x)
    print(X[i])
    append(y, seq_y)
  }
  df <- tibble(X, y)
  return(df)
}

raw_seq <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90)

n_steps <- 3

frampt <- splitter(column = raw_seq, n_steps = n_steps)

# Looks like the above didn't translate well from Python, so it doesn't work.
# Besides, this was probably getting into the weeds. I can do similar stuff using 
# mutates and such.

#### Conv1d Boston Houses Regression ####

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzoIHdkFcQU

# split data into train and test (by column)

# normalize data by taking the median and standard deviation
## train_data <- (train_data - median) / std
## test_data <- (test_data - median) / std

# Reshape data sets

## Desired Shape: [batch_size, time_steps, input_dimension]

## Current Shape: [batch_size, features]

## (Batch Size = Number of Samples)

## Convert 2D data to 3D via reshape

### sample_size <- train_data.shape[0] # number of samples in train set
### time_steps <- train_data.shape[1] # number of features in set
### input_dimension = 1 # each feature is represented by 1 number

### train_data_reshaped = train_data.reshape(sample_size, time_steps, input_dimension)

#### looks like each feature in the Boston House Prices set is the price at a given time

#### So my shape would be c(batch_size = n_buses, time_steps = n_rows, input_dimension = 1)

# probably use filters = 1, activation = 'relu'. Kernel size will take some intuition.


# c(batch_size = 58, time_steps = 2401, input_dimension = 1)

# Let's try the following layer structure:

model_alpha <- keras_model_sequential(name = "c1bvm_conv") %>% 
  layer_conv_1d(input_shape = c(2401, 1), filters = 64, kernel_size = 90, activation = 'relu',
                name = 'Conv1') %>% # 90 steps = 3s
  layer_max_pooling_1d(pool_size = 3, name = 'Pool1') %>% 
  layer_conv_1d(filters = 32, kernel_size = 30, activation = 'relu', name = 'Conv2') %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_1d(pool_size = 2, name = 'Pool2') %>% 
  layer_conv_1d(filters = 16, kernel_size = 15, activation = 'relu', name = 'Conv3') %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_1d(pool_size = 5, name = 'Pool3') %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.10) %>% 
  layer_flatten() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 32, activation = 'relu', name = 'Dense1') %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1, name = 'DenseOut')

summary(model_alpha)

# Compile
model_alpha %>% 
  compile(
    optimizer = "adam",
    loss = 'mse',
    metrics = "mse"
  )
