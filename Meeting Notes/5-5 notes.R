# Voltage angles: Derivative (rate of change) might be the important variable. Delta_Angle_Change
## Measured every 1/30th of a second.

# blog post for May 16: 

# look out for wrapping angles: Going to 180, it goes to -180. Could screw with algorithms, but it might not be a problem.
## Definitely care more about the rate of change than absolute values.

# This week, I want to see some oscillations. Make time-series plots of various columns. See what looks nice.
