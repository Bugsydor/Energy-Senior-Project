# spectral analysis

# Next week, show what you've learned about the data
## some plots would be nice.
## understand what's in the data

# short time-segments of data could be useful for regression (Short-term trends) 5min?
## try a few different fits (straight lines might not be useful)
## plot the data? (Look for sine-like oscillations)

# Look up R for spectral analysis?
## Oscillation data should give weird coefficients
